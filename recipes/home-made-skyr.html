      <p><strong>Skyr</strong> is a traditional icelandic dairy product, similar to yougurt, that was enjoyed by vikings.<br> It is high in protein and can be enjoyed with a variety of toppings</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 gallon (3.8 liters) whole milk (preferably non-homogenized for authenticity)</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk or 2-3 tablespoons of live Skyr as a starter culture</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp liquid animal rennet (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lukewarm water (if using rennet)</li>
        <li>Cheesecloth or fine muslin</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Large pot</li>
        <li>Thermomether</li>
        <li>Whisk</li>
        <li>Strainer</li>
        <li>Bowls</li>
        <li>ladle</li>
      </ul>  
    <h2>Steps</h2>    
      <ul>
        <li>Heat the Milk:
          <ul>
            <li>Pour the whole milk into a large pot and heat it gently to <strong>185°F (85°C)</strong> while stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.</li>
            <li>Once it reaches the temperature, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool down to <strong>104°F (40°C)</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add Starter Culture:
          <ul>
            <li>Add the buttermilk or live Skyr to the cooled milk. If you're using a starter culture in powder form, follow the package instructions.</li>
            <li>Stir thoroughly to ensure the starter culture is evenly distributed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add Rennet (Optional):
          <ul>
            <li>If using rennet for a firmer texture, dissolve the rennet in 1/4 cup of water and add it to the milk mixture. Stir gently for a few seconds to mix.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Incubation:
          <ul>
            <li>Cover the pot and keep it in a warm place to incubate. The ideal temperature for incubation is around <strong>104°F (40°C)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Allow the mixture to sit undisturbed for <strong>5-12 hours</strong>, or until it thickens to a yogurt-like consistency. The time may vary depending on the ambient temperature and the strength of your starter culture.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Strain the Skyr:
          <ul>
            <li>Once the Skyr has thickened, line a strainer with cheesecloth or muslin and place it over a bowl.</li>
            <li>Ladle the thickened Skyr into the strainer. Let it drain for several hours, or until it reaches your desired thickness. For a thicker Skyr, you can let it drain overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Store the Skyr:
          <ul>
            <li>Transfer the strained Skyr to a container and refrigerate.<strong>It will keep for about a week</strong>.</li>
            <li>You can use the whey (liquid that drains off) in smoothies, baking, or as a substitute for buttermilk.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>     
    <h2>Serving</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Just scoop the Skyr into bowls and enjoy it plain or with your favorite toppings</li>         
      </ul>
